    This page offers a look into my journey as a developer, from my early experiences with web design to the projects I’m working on today.

  <h3 class="yellow">Who Am I?</h3>
	<span>
    My love for nature and the outdoors keeps me grounded, whether I'm running ultramarathons, hiking through the woods, or simply taking in the fresh air. There's something about being in nature that brings clarity and balance to my life. I prioritize faith, family, and personal growth, spending Sundays at church and cherishing every moment with my wife and two daughters.

    <h3 class="light">Why Do I Code?</h3>
    <p>
      I love coding because of its structure and predictability—if the logic is sound, the results follow. When things don’t work, I get to break them down, rethink my approach, and try again. The challenge of problem-solving, the excitement of getting something to work, and the drive to make it even better keep me engaged. It’s a constant mental workout that sharpens my skills and pushes me to improve.

  <h3 class="teal">Early Start</h3>
	<span>
    My passion for web development began in 1998, at age 13, when I first started learning HTML. I was fascinated by how a few lines of code could shape a webpage, and I spent hours experimenting and building. In high school, I excelled in my Java class, quickly mastering the language and gaining the trust of my instructors.

  <p>
    This led to a rare opportunity—being given access to the entire school district's server, so that I could improve the design and functionality of various school web pages.

		<h3>Growth And Development</h3>
    <p>
      Not long after high school, I teamed up with friends to start an eCommerce business. My role was clear—I built the website and online store, laying the foundation for our digital presence. This hands-on experience reinforced my love for web development and set me on a path to deepen my skills. Later, I pursued and earned a certification in the MERN stack, sharpening my expertise in modern web technologies and full-stack development.

  <h3 class="magenta">Current Project Updates</h3>
  <span>
    I continue to grow as a developer through constant learning, using free online resources, experimentation, and real-world practice. My current focus is on Python, which I’ve integrated into my backend development workflow. Right now, I’m working on a Python web framework, pushing myself to create efficient, flexible solutions from the ground up. Each project I take on is an opportunity to refine my skills and explore new possibilities in development.
